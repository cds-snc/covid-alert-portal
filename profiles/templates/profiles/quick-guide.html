        <h2>Part of the COVID Alert system</h2>
        <p>The COVID Alert Portal is part of the system behind Canada’s free exposure notification app, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html" target="_blank">COVID Alert</a>.</p>
        <p>COVID Alert does not replace manual contact tracing by local health authorities. It is just one part of the public health effort to limit the spread of COVID-19.</p>

        <h3>One-time keys turn on exposure notifications</h3>
        <p>You’ll give one-time keys to patients with COVID-19 who want to notify people they’ve been near. <b>Only give one key per patient.</b></p>
        <p>Before giving a key, check the patient has the COVID Alert app on their phone.</p>
        <h3>How the portal displays a one-time key</h3>

        <p>The portal gives instructions for entering the key, with screenshots from the app. You can use the instructions to help patients enter the key.</p>
        <h2>Only authorized healthcare workers generate and give one-time keys</h2>
        <p>By entering the key, the patient confirms they have COVID-19. Then the app guides the patient through the steps to notify people of possible exposure.</p>
        <p>Notifications do not give information about the patient or time of exposure.</p>
        <h2>Only generate keys for real patients</h2>
        <p>By comparing 3 stats, we can learn how people use the app. We need the number of:</p>
        <ul><li>People with COVID -19.</li>
        <li>One-time keys generated for patients.</li>
        <li>Patients who enter keys in the app.</li></ul>
        <p>To keep stats accurate, only generate a key when you intend to give it to a patient. This condition is part of our <a href="{{ terms_url }}">terms of use</a>.</p>
        <h2>Create an account to generate keys</h2>
        <p>You’ll get an email if you’re invited to create a portal account. Check your spam folder for the email.</p>
        <p>Both administrators and healthcare workers can generate one-time keys.</p>
        <p>Administrators can also:</p>
        <ul><li>Invite healthcare workers to create portal accounts.</li>
        <li>Delete portal accounts.</li></ul>
        <h3>Keep a mobile phone with you</h3>
        <p>The portal texts a security code to your mobile phone:</p>
        <ul><li>When you create your account.</li>
        <li>Anytime you log in.</li></ul>
        <h3>Check your browser is compatible</h3>
        <p>The portal works on any mobile or desktop device using a browser with automatic updates, including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera and Safari. It’s also supported on Internet Explorer 11.</p>
        <h2>If the portal is down</h2>
        <h3>Follow local procedures for patients who need keys</h3>
        <p>Public health authorities must determine what to do for:</p>
        <ul><li>Situations when an individual healthcare worker cannot use their portal account.</li>
        <li>System-wide portal outages.</li></ul>
        <h3>Contact us for tech support</h3>
