        <p>You’ll give one-time keys to patients with COVID-19 who want to notify people they’ve been near. <b>Only give one key per patient.</b></p>
        <p>Before giving a key, check the patient has the COVID Alert app on their phone.</p>

        <p>The portal also links to detailed instructions. You can use the instructions to help patients enter the key.</p>
        <h2>Only authorized healthcare workers generate and give one-time keys</h2>
        <p>By entering the key, the patient confirms they have COVID-19. Then the app guides the patient through the steps to notify people of possible exposure.</p>
        <p>Notifications do not give information about the patient or time of exposure.</p>
        <h2>Only generate keys for real patients</h2>
        <p>By comparing 3 stats, we can improve the COVID Alert system by learning how people use the app.  We need the number of: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>People with COVID-19.</li>
            <li>One-time keys generated for patients.</li>
            <li>Patients who enter keys in the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To keep stats accurate, <b>only</b> generate a key when you intend to give it to a patient. This condition is part of our <a href="{{ terms_url }}" target="_blank">terms of use</a>.</p>
